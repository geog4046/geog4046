# Example: Simple CSS
This example demonstrates how the `class` attribute can be used on HTML elements to change the style of the element. To create these different styles, rules are specified in a stylesheet file (css/simple.css).  
- Look at index.html to see the HTML elements (e.g., the `div` elements, which are visible as rectangles on the webpage).
- Look at css/simple.css to see the rules that specify how the `div` elements should look (e.g., the rule `.green { background-color: green }` will make the `div` with the `green` class appear with a green background).

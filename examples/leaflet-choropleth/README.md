# Example: Leaflet Choropleth Map
This is an implementation of the "Interactive Choropleth Map" example on the Leaflet website (https://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/). Here we use jQuery to read a GeoJSON file of population density instead of putting the data into a .js file. We also use an OSM basemap instead of Mapbox.
- Create a basemap and fetch the GeoJSON data.
- Create functions that add styles to the map, like changing the colors of state borders.
- Set the color of each state based on the state's population density value, i.e., change symbology based on attribute values.
- Use event listeners to respond to user input, i.e., change the map zoom or color when the user clicks a state or moves the mouse over a state.
- Use JavaScript to generate an HTML element--a box to display basic info about a state.

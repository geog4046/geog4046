# Example: External GeoJSON
- Use jQuery to read GeoJSON from a web service (USGS earthquakes)
- Use Leaflet to display the earthquake locations as markers on a map
- Use event listeners to respond to clicks on the earthquake markers and show a popup
- Create a control to switch basemaps and show/hide the earthquake layer

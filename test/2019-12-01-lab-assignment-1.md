In this assignment we will follow Esri's ArcGIS Online "Get Started" guide to create a web map showing three layers of data: hurricane evacuation routes, car ownership, and a basemap. The web app also provides tools to navigate the map, zoom, toggle layers, and other controls.

## Data
This exercise uses data layers that are available on ArcGIS Online. For reference their ArcGIS Online Item Details pages are linked below:  
- [Hurricane Evacuation Routes](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=8dd859379d904396b776f5428afc8f10)  
- [Houston Demographics by Census Tracts](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=69016c145246426bb13cd90c92b3118d)  
- [World Light Gray Base](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=ed712cb1db3e4bae9e85329040fb9a49)  

## Process
1. Create an ArcGIS Online Public Account (not a free trial): <https://www.arcgis.com/home/createaccount.html>  
   * Note that you will have to provide an email address. **Do not** use your university email address, which will be used later for an organizational account.  
2. Follow the tutorial [Get Started with ArcGIS Online](https://learn.arcgis.com/en/projects/get-started-with-arcgis-online/) but keep in mind the "Try it" section below regarding some of the steps that you will customize.

## Try it
- Select a new basemap ([Add a layer](https://learn.arcgis.com/en/projects/get-started-with-arcgis-online/#subsection-2), Step 7).  
- Pick your own symbology for both layers ([Change the style](https://learn.arcgis.com/en/projects/get-started-with-arcgis-online/#subsection-4), Steps 4 and 5; [Add demographic data](https://learn.arcgis.com/en/projects/get-started-with-arcgis-online/#subsection-5), Steps 12 and 13).  
- Do one of the following (see [Create a web app](https://learn.arcgis.com/en/projects/get-started-with-arcgis-online/#subsection-7) and [Configure the app](https://learn.arcgis.com/en/projects/get-started-with-arcgis-online/#subsection-8)):
  - Choose your own configurable app template instead of the Basic Viewer.
  - Choose the Basic Viewer template and customize the various options described in the tutorial.  
- Launch your web app and copy the URL.
- Take a screenshot of your web app and use it for the thumbnail.    
    
## Submit
1. The only text you will turn in for this assignment is the URL to your web app. Example: `https://www.arcgis.com/apps/View/index.html?appid=12345ABCDE`
